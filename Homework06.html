  <h1> Biography</h1>
  <p> My name is Greg Pina and I absolutely adore working with computers. Ever since I was younger I have put<br>
  together computer builds for myself and for friends. I am currently 27 years old and am just now going back<br>
  to school. I am dual-enrolled in Network Engineering Technology and Computer Programming & Database Management.<br>
  My dream is to also pursue a Bachelor's in Computer Science and to become a software engineer for Twitch.tv.<br>
  Outside of computers I also enjoy music and try to go to as many concerts as I can.
